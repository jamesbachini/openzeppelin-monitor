> :warning: This software is in alpha. Use in production environments at your own risk.

In the rapidly evolving world of blockchain technology, effective monitoring is crucial for ensuring security and performance. OpenZeppelin Monitor is a blockchain monitoring service that watches for specific on-chain activities and triggers notifications based on configurable conditions. The service offers multi-chain support with configurable monitoring schedules, flexible trigger conditions, and an extensible architecture for adding new chains.

```

### Setup

To get started, run the following commands to install pre-commit hooks:

- Install pre-commit hooks:

  ```bash
  pip install pre-commit
  pre-commit install --install-hooks -t commit-msg -t pre-commit -t pre-push
  ```

  > :warning: If you encounter issues with pip, consider using [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/) for a global installation.

- Install the toolchain:

  ```bash
  rustup component add rustfmt
  ```

### Run Tests

To run tests, use the following commands:

```bash
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test properties
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test integration
```

### Generate Test Coverage Report

_Interactive HTML Report_

```sh
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo +stable llvm-cov --html --open
```

_CLI Report_

```sh
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo +stable llvm-cov
```

## Important Considerations

### Performance Considerations

- Monitor performance depends on network congestion and RPC endpoint reliability.
- The `max_past_blocks` configuration is critical:
  - Calculate as: `(cron_interval_ms/block_time_ms) + confirmation_blocks + 1` (defaults to this calculation if not specified).
  - Example for 1-minute Ethereum cron: `(60000/12000) + 12 + 1 = 18 blocks`.
  - Too low settings may result in missed blocks.
- Trigger conditions are executed sequentially based on their position in the trigger conditions array. Proper execution also depends on the number of available file descriptors on your system. Ideally, you should increase the open file descriptor limit to at least 2,048 or higher for optimal performance.
  - Security Risk: Only run scripts that you trust and fully understand. Malicious scripts can harm your system or expose sensitive data. Always review script contents and verify their source before execution.
  - HTTP requests to RPC endpoints may consume file descriptors for each connection. The number of concurrent connections can increase significantly when processing blocks with many transactions, as each transaction may require multiple RPC calls.

### Notification Considerations

- Email notification port defaults to 465 if not specified.
- Template variables are context-dependent:
  - Event-triggered notifications only populate event variables.
  - Function-triggered notifications only populate function variables.
  - Mixing contexts results in empty values.
